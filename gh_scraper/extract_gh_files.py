*Task*:
Rate the repository's legitimacy on a scale of 1-5, where:
    1 = High likelihood of plagiarism or embellishment
    5 = Original work
Err on the side of skepticismâ€”only assign a 4 or 5 if there is clear, consistent, and meaningful development from the candidate.

*Red Flags to Watch For*:
- Large initial commits followed by minimal contributions (suggesting bulk copy-pasting)
- Code copied from well-known sources (e.g., GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow, or open-source projects)
- Minimal meaningful code contributions (e.g., mostly modifying comments, formatting, or renaming variables)
- Inconsistent coding style (indicating possible multiple authors)
- Commits with drastic jumps in complexity (suggesting pasted code rather than iterative development)
- Sudden, short bursts of activity followed by long inactivity (suggesting last-minute additions rather than steady progress)
- Missing implementation details for complex claims in the resume

*Response Format*:

Repo #1: [rating]
