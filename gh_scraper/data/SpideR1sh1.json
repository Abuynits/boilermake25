    "experience_data": "1. [5]\nReasoning: The candidate experiences as the first intern at Armada AI and their involvement in building Edge AI applications align with current industry trends and technology. \n\n2. [5]\nReasoning: The development of spatially aware computer vision (CV) and large language model (LLM) robotic control methods is plausible, particularly with common techniques such as generating synthetic data for model fine-tuning.\n\n3. [4]\nReasoning: Building a VideoQA assistant for real-time questioning based on security camera footage is a recognizable application and could feasibly be part of an intern's tasks, though it is speculative without further context.\n\n4. [4]\nReasoning: Creating a prompting library may be an ambitious task for an intern, but is valid considering modern practices in LLM development. Still, the complexity might be high for an entry-level role.\n\n5. [5]\nReasoning: Conducting research under a professor suggests the candidate is actively engaging in academic pursuits, which matches expectations for a candidate in a technology-focused role.\n\n6. [5]\nReasoning: Extending a simulator for specific robotic applications, especially in widely used platforms like Gazebo and PyBullet, is a credible claim and indicative of technical skills.\n\n7. [4]\nReasoning: Researching motion planning in dynamic environments is a relevant and advanced topic within robotics. While valid, the specifics may be hard to verify without further details.\n\n8. [4]\nReasoning: Teaching robots to navigate using LLMs and associated technologies is an ambitious project but plausible, especially within a university or research setting.\n\n9. [5]\nReasoning: Developing mechatronic/software solutions for satellite assembly aligns with known work related to aerospace and technology companies, making this claim credible.\n\n10. [5]\nReasoning: Prototyping assembly cells with robotics and automation technologies is within the realm of possibility and reflects industry practices in modern manufacturing.\n\n11. [5]\nReasoning: Achieving a significant speedup in communication protocols through library development is feasible given the candidate's focus on performance improvements in computation.\n\n12. [4]\nReasoning: Creating automation scripts in multiple programming languages is quite practical, though the specific savings of $200k is a strong claim that could require verification."
