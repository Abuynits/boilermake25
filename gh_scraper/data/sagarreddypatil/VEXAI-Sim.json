{"description": null, "readme": "# VEXAI Simulation and Training\n\nCheck out our [technical report here!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14385)\n\nSimulation\n1. Download Repo\n2. Launch repo in latest unity version\n\nTraining\n1. Install anaconda python virutal enviroment manager - conda on package managers, lookup anaconda online for windows download\n2. Navigate to where you downloaded the simulation\n3. Run command inside terminal in linux or anaconda powershell prompt on windows `conda create --name name python=3.6`\n4. Run command `conda activate name`\n2. Install required python packages to run the Unity ml-agents package\n  a. Run `python -m pip install mlagents==0.26.0` inside your virtual environment, if on windows PyTorch will have to be installed separetly and you may have to run command sudo if errors \n    https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Installation.md\n3. Press the play button in the unity editor\n4. Run `mlagents-learn mlagents-config.yaml` to train on our hyperparameters\n  Edit the mlagents-config.yaml file for tuning your own hyperparameters\n\nTensorboard logging\n1. Open a separate terminal from the one that is training the model\n2. Navigate to the directory where the simulation is, activate the virtual enviroment, and run `tensorboard --logdir /results`\n3. In a browser enter \"http://localhost:6006/\" for your tensorboard stats\n", "prev_commits": ["Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/BLRSAI/VEXAI-Sim", "motion blur", "set model inputs to zero to test what would happen", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/BLRSAI/VEXAI-Sim", "ring randomization", "bruh fix", "teenytiny change", "make observations better???", "more bruh", "bruh is kil", "unfuck Game.unity", "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/old-normalize'", "do local transform stuff", "fix teh code", "fixed update", "progress", "Merge pull request #1 from BLRSAI/jacob-scoring", "minor progress", "fix whoopsie", "clip input speed and rot values", "prelim python stuff", "fix a bunch of stuff", "Fixed small error", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/BLRSAI/VEXAI-Sim", "refactor a ton of stuff", "add results to gitignore", "stuff", "bruh", "tensorboard stuff", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/BLRSAI/VEXAI-Sim", "reexport env", "fix mogo randomization", "add proper colliders to mogos", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/BLRSAI/VEXAI-Sim", "rotate observations"], "title": "VEXAI-Sim", "owner": "BLRSAI", "commits": 35}
