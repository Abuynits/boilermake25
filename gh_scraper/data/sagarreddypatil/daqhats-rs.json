{"description": null, "readme": "# MCC DAQ HAT Library for Raspberry Pi - Rust Bindings\n\nIncomplete Rust bindings for the [MCC DAQ HAT Library for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/mccdaq/daqhats) v1.5.0.0\n\nThe daqhats library must be installed to build and use this library.\n\nCurrently only supports the MCC 118.\n\nTo cross compile a project that uses this library, you can copy `Dockerfile` and `dev-container.sh` to your project directory and run `./dev-container.sh` to start a container in your current directory, running on aarch64 (emulated if your host isn't aarch64). The container installs the daqhats library and the Rust toolchain.\n\n## Continuous Scan Example\n\nSee `examples/mcc118_continuous.rs`\n", "prev_commits": ["nevermind", "dockerfile arm64", "add example for new interface", "idiomatic rust", "refactor", "changes", "build warnings", "Create LICENSE", "add it to examples dir", "readme example", "move stuff into lib", "mcc118 bindings", "bindings compile", "initial commit"], "title": "daqhats-rs", "owner": "sagarreddypatil", "commits": 14}
