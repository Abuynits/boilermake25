The project focuses on precise hardware emulation to recreate the classic NES gaming experience while maintaining clear and modular code design.\n\n---\n\n## **Features**\n\n- **Hardware Emulation**:\n   - Emulates the NES CPU (6502), PPU (Picture Processing Unit), and memory-mapped I/O for accurate gameplay.\n- **Cross-Platform**:\n   - Developed with **SDL**, ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n- **Simple and Functional Design**:\n   - Modular structure for readability and maintainability.\n- **Classic NES Games**:\n   - Load and play ROMs of original NES games for a nostalgic retro gaming experience.\n\n---\n\n## **Getting Started**\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)\n- **SDL2 Library**:  \n  Install SDL2 on your system:  \n  - On Ubuntu/Debian:  \n    ```bash\n    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\n    ```\n  - On macOS (Homebrew):  \n    ```bash\n    brew install sdl2\n    ```\n  - On Windows: Download the SDL2 development library from [libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org).\n\n### Building the Project\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/SpideR1sh1/nes-emulator.git\n   cd nes-emulator\n   ```\n\n2. Compile the project:\n   ```bash\n   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o nes_emulator -lSDL2\n   ```\n\n3. Run the emulator:\n   ```bash\n   ./nes_emulator\n   ```\n\n### Running ROMs\n\n1. Place a valid NES ROM file (e.g., `game.nes`) in the project directory.\n2. Run the emulator and specify the ROM file as an argument:\n   ```bash\n   ./nes_emulator game.nes\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## **Technical Details**\n\n- **CPU Emulation**:\n   - Implements the **6502 processor** instruction set for NES games.\n- **PPU (Graphics) Emulation**:\n   - Simulates the NES **Picture Processing Unit** for accurate frame rendering.\n- **Input Handling**:\n   - Uses SDL to manage keyboard inputs for NES controllers.\n- **Memory Management**:\n   - Implements memory-mapped I/O for accurate game state emulation.\n\n---\n\n## **Screenshots**\n\n*(Add screenshots here of games running on your emulator)*\n\n---\n\n## **Planned Features**\n\n- Save states for game progress.  \n- Rewind functionality for enhanced gameplay.  \n- Improved performance optimization.  \n- Audio emulation for full NES sound support.\n\n---\n\n## **Tech Stack**\n\n- **Language**: C++  \n- **Libraries**: SDL2  \n- **Tools**: G++/Clang (Compiler), Make (Build System)\n\n---\n\n## **Contributing**\n\nContributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the emulator or add new features.\n\n---\n\n## **License**\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
