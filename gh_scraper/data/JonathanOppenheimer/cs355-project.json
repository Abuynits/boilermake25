To test our solution, please follow the steps below.\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, Python must be installed. Please visit [the official Python site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download and install.\n\nNext, install the external libraries (listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)) for our solution. \n\n```\ncd cs355-project\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Testing \n\nTo test our solution, open two terminal windows. Run `python bob.py` first in one, and then `python alice.py` in the other. Our protocol will then be executed. Feel free to play around with the code segments available in [alices-code](./alices-code/) and [bobs-code](./bobs-code/). \n\n## Further information\n\nEducational information regarding our specification is available in [our specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I59-cGoVXxlLvVidBt5UiqzaQsxMaJ8g8UgOeDBeUic/edit?usp=sharing).\n", "prev_commits": ["merge", "Add readme, update requirements", "Delete .vscode directory", "Delete __pycache__ directory", "Add gitignore and finish code", "Fix bug", "Delete extraneous code", "Finish up to Alice intersection (buggy)", "add some examples", "stuff for sra", "Fix primes", "try to send primes", "add basic project setup"], "title": "cs355-project", "owner": "JonathanOppenheimer", "commits": 13}
