Particles are created at random positions and move in random directions. \n\n### Quadtree\nImplementing quadtree for collision detection: <br>\n<img src=\"quad.gif\" width=\"600\" width=\"600\" >\n\n### Collisions\nImplemented collision detection using quadtree. The quadtree is used to divide the space into smaller regions and store the particles in the regions. This allows for faster collision detection as we only need to check for collisions between particles in the same region: <br>\n<img src=\"collision.gif\" width=\"600\" width=\"600\" >\n\n### Particle Life\nThis is a simple particle life simulation. Particles are created at random positions and move in random directions initially. There is a attraction force based on the color of the particles. Here, it starts with no forces, then all red particles are attracted to each other, then all green particles are attracted to red particles. It is interesting to see how the particles move based on the forces.\n\n<img src=\"particle.gif\" width=\"600\" width=\"600\" >\n", "prev_commits": ["sus", "window size", "particle life works", "particle life works", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/harmya/particle-life", "update .gitignore", "Update README.md", "upload particle gif", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "i am dumb", "what", "size", "imeplement sim", "matrix", "dont draw quadtree", "final for now", "remove quadtree overlap", "implement wrap around", "implement move particle wrap around", "wrap around for query", "remove existing", "implementing wrap around", "delete if else", "Update README.md", "upload", "now next time", "ok", "it works", "it works", "remove restrict", "am", "attraction matrix"], "title": "particle-life", "owner": "harmya", "commits": 35}
