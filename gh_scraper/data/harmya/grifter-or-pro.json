{"description": null, "readme": "### Grifter or Pro? (WIP)\n\nEver wondered if the stuff people put on their resume is actually true?\n\nEspecially when they put coding projects with grandiose descriptions?\n\nWell, lets find out.\n\nFor now, I have implemented a basic resume parser that can parse the resume and extract the information.\nI have also implemented a basic GitHub repo verifier that can verify the GitHub repos and check if the projects are actually real.\nAfter that, I randomly sample files from the GitHub repos and use a LLM to analyze the code and the project description and give a \"grift\" rating.\n\nExample:\n\nI put this on my resume: \"Created a self-driving car system that learns to navigate through traffic using a neural network to process sensory input and make decisions using JavaScript, HTML and CSS\"\n\nNow, after running the verifier, my review is:\n\n\"Oh, sweet code of mine, what have we here? A self-driving car system that sounds like it was designed by someone who thinks \"neural network\" is just a fancy term for a group chat!\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the code, shall we? First off, your project description is like a toddler claiming they can cook a five-course meal because they microwaved a Hot Pocket. You\u2019re not exactly building Skynet here; you\u2019re just trying to avoid a fender bender with some polygons.\"\n\nKinda funny, hopefully I don't lose interest in this before I finish the web app.\n", "prev_commits": ["stupid", "Create nextjs.yml", "cooked", "ok", "cooked", "cooked", "cooked", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/harmya/grifter-or-pro", "cooked", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "readme was bad", "goofy project", "Initial commit from Create Next App"], "title": "grifter-or-pro", "owner": "harmya", "commits": 15}
