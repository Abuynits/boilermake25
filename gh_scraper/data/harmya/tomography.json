{"description": "Simulation of a tomographic reconstruction in CT scan machines", "readme": "# Computed Tomography\n\nTomographic reconstruction is a type of inverse problem where the challenge is to yield an estimate of a specific system from a finite number of projections.\nOne of the coolest parts of this process is the fourier slice theorem: the 1D Fourier Transform of the projection of an object at angle $\\Theta$ is equal to the slice of the 2D Fourier Transform of the object at angle $\\Theta$.\nUsing this, we can take multiple projections to construct the 2D Fourier Transform of the object, and then take its inverse to get the original object.\n\n# Example\n![CAT Scan](https://github.com/harmya/tomography/blob/main/assets/dogscan.gif)\n", "prev_commits": ["Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/harmya/tomography", "final version", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "no real image animation", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/harmya/tomography", "fixed fft mask", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Update README.md", "Final assets", "uploaded demo", "all animations work", "Add files via upload", "Delete josh.gif", "Update README.md", "readme update", ".gitignore is now working", "Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/harmya/tomography", "gitignore", "Create README.md", "works, have to implement fourier slice theorem", "no animation"], "title": "tomography", "owner": "harmya", "commits": 24}
