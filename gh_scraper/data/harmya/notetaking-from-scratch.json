{"description": null, "readme": "### Signal Processing Speech to Text using CNNs\n\nThis is an old project that was used as a base for a notetaking implementation using speech to text. This model was too small and took too long to train with the resources I had. Ended up using pretrained models because this was so bad lol. But it was a good learning experience to learn a bit of signal processing and how to use CNNs for speech to text.\n\n2025 update: Honestly, I don't remember much about this project. Just putting it on github for the sake of it.\n", "prev_commits": ["Update README.md", "first commit"], "title": "notetaking-from-scratch", "owner": "harmya", "commits": 2}
