{"description": null, "readme": "### Overview\nThis project aims to come up with machine learning models capable of classifying whether a target word is used in the same context across two different sentences. Our binary classification system labels pairs of sentences as 'True' (T) if the word usage is contextually similar, or 'False' (F) if the context differs.\n\n### Data Example\n![Example](https://github.com/harmya/words-in-context/blob/main/wic_examples.png?raw=true)\n", "prev_commits": ["cooked", "dan", "accuracy functions", "new dan curve", "plot test loss", "added test loss", "learning curves", "dont change dan now", "bruv", "final architectures", "i am seeing things", "damn", "randomize", "blud", "word to index done", "readme update", "lstm taking too long", "remove stuff that messed up the execution", "ok it works", "data output", "works?", "convert to numpy", "we cooked", "refactor", "change stuff", "refactor", "goya", "i am sleeping bruh", "we are not cooking", "ok we cooking", "rnn broke", "we cooked", "rnn cooking", "rnn changed", "lstm is killing me"], "title": "words-in-context", "owner": "harmya", "commits": 35}
